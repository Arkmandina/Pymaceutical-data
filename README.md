          Final Analysis
This analysis used merged data from two databases to come up with the most conclusive results on different drug types effects on tumors in mice
Using th merged data, we were able to gather statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation as well as standard error based on the drug type used in different mice.
To further breakdown the effects, graphs were used to best show the correlation between tumor growth or depreciation based on the amount time using the drug.
The analysis opted to show graphically that correlation broken down in the drug Capomulin due to it having the most data from mice and no outliers.
With Capomulin, the data shows that the best results stem from using the drug for at least 30 days. It also shows that using it for a period of 40 days or more, can actual increase the size of tumors again.
For this drug, the correlation between the weight of the mice and the average tumor volume was also tracked.

In summary, the cleaned data and charts can help with deciding with what drugs to move forward with for additional trials and what drugs might need additional data before doing any additional testing.
